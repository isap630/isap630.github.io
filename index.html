                Hi there :&#41;
            </h2>
            <p>
                As a current student majoring in Emerging Media and minoring in Computer Science,
                I have developed and continued to grow my passion for digital media, technology, and design. 
                Over the past few years I have been able to learn a variety of design skills and tools including Adobe Creative Cloud,
                Front-End Coding Languages, and UX/UI skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides my interest in User Interface Design, I am a photographer and scenic view lover. 
                Appreciating simple things and living in the moment in life is valuable to me, 
                (which is understandable as someone from a busy city lol) therefore I especially love capturing simplicity. 
                I love walking and exploring around the city and capturing small details that some people might overlook due to 
                the busyness of living in New York. My work is a reflection of my views as I like to create and capture simple 
                things that are still able to be appreciated by anyone.
